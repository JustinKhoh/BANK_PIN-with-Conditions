# BANK_PIN-with-Conditions

Your PIN must fulfil the following requirements
  1) Each pin should have 6 digits
  2) No repetition of a number 3 times in a row, e.g. "111" or "222", etc.
  3) No 3 consecutive numbers "123" or "234", etc 

This is my attempt at trying to enforce said requirements on a fake pin**
